# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Js Syntax** - Coming from c++ and python, I expected for js to have similar syntaxes with the other 2. What I didn't anticipate however, is that the syntaxes for js is way simpler compared to that of c++ and python. One thing I really found convinient is that with js, the data type of a variable is automatically assigned based on the value. For example, if x = 5 then it would be an integer, but if x = "Hello" then it would automatically be a string variable without needing to declare it. The syntaxes for js are very straight-forward, short, and easy to use.
2. **I/O statements** - Input output statements are statements that include functions where a user must input a certain value in order for the code to generate an output for it. Depending on what data type is being asked for, the outputs may vary. They are short and easy to use actually. There are many statements that can be used to get an input and output.
3. **Loops** - Loops are a block of code that do a certain task until a set condition is met. When that condition is met, the loop is stopped and is exited from. I think that loops are useful as not only can they shorten your code, but they can also do something for you automatically rather than having to code manually.
4. **Conditional Statements** - Conditional statements control a code's next course of action. They are like doors that need keys to be opened, if you happen to have a certain key, you will unlock the path behind that door. The importance of conditional statements is amplified in loop statements, if the set conditional statement is not correct, then your code will end up being an infinite loop.
5. **Functions** - Functions, just like loops, are also a block of code that is assigned to do a certain task and either return a value or nothing. When called, functions perform actions on the variable/s that they are asked to make changes in. I would also like to note that they are completely separate from the main function itself.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Js Syntax** - I mentioned earlier that these are simple to understand; however, I am still prone to making mistakes (such as typos) that can possibly cause an error within the code. 
2. **I/O statements** - On their own, I am able to code such statements. When they are grouped together to form a block of code however, I start to struggle with trying to connect all of them.
3. **While Loops** - For some reason, whenever I try to use while loops for my code, I fail at actually making it work, so I resort to the for loop instead.
4. **Functions** - I can make functions, but I rarely use them in actual coding assessments.
5. **Variable Declaration** - This is connected to loops. Most of the time, I make unnecessary variables to serve as a placeholder for another variable's value and I am unable to make it work as it was intended for.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I will learn eventually. So if I keep on coding, I will come to the understanding of the code and get better. Obviously I am not throwing away the idea of checking online resources about things that I have a hard time with. I can practice with my new knowledge and make something out of them.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## Helpful
1. **Speed test** - Something about the short time limit made me think faster of ways that I can get the result that is being asked of me.
2. **Graded Exercises** - They are exercises that are made to enhance our skills in coding, and that it did. The graded part is also a bonus since it is a part of our grade after all.
3. **Kahoot** - It literally helps us learn in a fun way. It was successful in reviewing me for the quiz.

## Not effective
1. **Quizzes** - I am not saying that it is entirely useless, but I personally think that it isn't effective compared to the other 3 I mentioned. I personally find it to have like a toll on me since it is relatively grade heavy.
2. **LT** - Again, it isn't useless, it's just that the thought that it is grade heavy isn't entirely motivating at all, it just pressures you into possibly screwing up. That is the case for me at least.
